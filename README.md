# Hate Speech Detection with Transformers
This repository contains a work-in-progress implementation of a hate speech detection system using transformer-based models (e.g., mBERT). The project is part of an ongoing research effort exploring the effectiveness of multilingual and cross-lingual models in low-resource language settings.

ðŸ”¬ Current status:
This is an active research project, and the repository is updated regularly as I work on a corresponding research paper. Expect ongoing changes, experimental code, and iterative improvements.
